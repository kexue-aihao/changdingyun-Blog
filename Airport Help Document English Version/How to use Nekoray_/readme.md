2. Open Nekoray, open Preferences, then click Basic Settings. In the General column, change the download test URL to the GitHub project package address. The method is the same as V2rayN, so I wonâ€™t go into details.

6. After completing the above settings, click the OK button to save the software configuration.

7. In the preferences, open the group settings, then select New Group, then change the type from Basic to Subscription, then check Manually adjust the column width, then fill in the remarks of your subscription in the name, and then copy the subscription from the official website URL, paste it into the URL address below, then click OK and save. After saving, update the subscription, download the node information, then select the node, turn on the system agent and start using it.
