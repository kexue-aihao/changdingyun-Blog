1. Attention! Notice! Notice! There is no small rocket Shadowrocket in China. The small rockets or Shadowrocket in China are all fakes that are trying to sell their products. Even if it's not from China, there are some that look similar, so be sure to look for "Shadowrocket". You can confirm it's genuine software through "Developer Information".

2. To use a free shared Apple account, you must log in from the App Store. Do not log in to "iCloud", otherwise it may cause the phone to lock or privacy leaks!
When logging in, two dialog boxes will pop up. Select "Other options" in the first one and "Do not upgrade" in the second one. Never choose two-factor authentication to upgrade account security, otherwise the account password will be reset and the shared account will no longer be able to be used.

3. I have downloaded Shadowrocket and want to update it using a shared account. Is this okay? no! You can only uninstall the original app and re-download it, because App Store updates must use the ID used when downloading. If you update with another ID, you will be prompted to deactivate the account, lock the account, or require you to enter the password again, etc. In short, you can only re-download, not update, unless you have the ID used for the original download.
